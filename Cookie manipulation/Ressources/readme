If we open local browser storage and look for information, we can see that we have some data:
I_am_admin:"68934a3e9455fa72420237eb05902327"

If we put it in crackstation, this is what we get:
68934a3e9455fa72420237eb05902327	md5	false

This md5 hash is storing false "value". We should try to change it to false ! Lets create a md5 hash storing "true"
