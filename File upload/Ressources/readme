We can upload jpg extension in file upload page:

tmp/image.jpg succesfully uploaded.

A great way to exploit such feature would be to upload malicious file containing malicious code. But .jpg is the only extension working.

echo 'bash' > image.jpg

Upload the image and observe network tab. Edit and resend, and change extension from .jpg to .php
